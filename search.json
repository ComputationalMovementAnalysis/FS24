    "text": "Download this Demoscript via “&lt;/&gt;Code” (top right)\nDepending on your knowledge of R, getting an overview of the data we imported last week might have been quite a challenge. Surprisingly enough, importing, cleaning and exploring your data can be the most challenging, time consuming part of a project. RStudio and the tidyverse offer many helpful tools to make this part easier (and more fun). You have read chapters on dplyr and magrittr as a preparation for this exercise. Before we start with the exercise however, this demo illustrates a simple approach offered by tidyverse which is applicable to sf-objects.\nAssume we want to calculate the timelag between subsequent positions. To achieve this we can use the function difftime() combined with lead() from dplyr. Let’s look at these functions one by one.\n\ndifftime\ndifftime takes two POSIXct values.\n\nnow &lt;- Sys.time()\n\nlater &lt;- now + 10000\n\nlater\n\n[1] \"2024-03-19 14:36:44 CET\"\n\ntime_difference &lt;- difftime(later, now)\n\ntime_difference\n\nTime difference of 2.777778 hours\n\n\nYou can also specify the unit of the output.\n\ntime_difference &lt;- difftime(later, now, units = \"mins\")\n\ntime_difference\n\nTime difference of 166.6667 mins\n\n\n\n\n\nlead() / lag()\nlead() and lag() return a vector of the same length as the input, just offset by a specific number of values (default is 1). Consider the following sequence:\n\nnumbers &lt;- 1:10\n\nnumbers\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nWe can now run lead() and lag() on this sequence to illustrate the output. n = specifies the offset, default = specifies the default value used to “fill” the emerging “empty spaces” of the vector. This helps us performing operations on subsequent values in a vector (or rows in a table).\n\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\n\nlead(numbers)\n\n [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 NA\n\nlead(numbers, n = 2)\n\n [1]  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 NA NA\n\nlag(numbers)\n\n [1] NA  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n\nlag(numbers, n = 5)\n\n [1] NA NA NA NA NA  1  2  3  4  5\n\nlag(numbers, n = 5, default = 0)\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\nmutate()\nUsing the above functions (difftime() and lead()), we can calculate the time lag, that is, the time difference between consecutive positions. We will try this on a dummy version of our wildboar dataset.\n\nwildschwein &lt;- tibble(\n    TierID = c(rep(\"Hans\", 5), rep(\"Klara\", 5)),\n    DatetimeUTC = rep(as.POSIXct(\"2015-01-01 00:00:00\", tz = \"UTC\") + 0:4 * 15 * 60, 2)\n)\n\nwildschwein\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   TierID DatetimeUTC        \n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dttm&gt;             \n 1 Hans   2015-01-01 00:00:00\n 2 Hans   2015-01-01 00:15:00\n 3 Hans   2015-01-01 00:30:00\n 4 Hans   2015-01-01 00:45:00\n 5 Hans   2015-01-01 01:00:00\n 6 Klara  2015-01-01 00:00:00\n 7 Klara  2015-01-01 00:15:00\n 8 Klara  2015-01-01 00:30:00\n 9 Klara  2015-01-01 00:45:00\n10 Klara  2015-01-01 01:00:00\n\n\nTo calculate the timelag with base-R, we need to mention wildschwein three times\n\nwildschwein$timelag &lt;- as.numeric(difftime(lead(wildschwein$DatetimeUTC), wildschwein$DatetimeUTC))\n\nUsing mutate() we can simplify this operation slightly:\n\nwildschwein &lt;- mutate(wildschwein, timelag = as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC)))\n\nwildschwein\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   TierID DatetimeUTC         timelag\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dttm&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Hans   2015-01-01 00:00:00      15\n 2 Hans   2015-01-01 00:15:00      15\n 3 Hans   2015-01-01 00:30:00      15\n 4 Hans   2015-01-01 00:45:00      15\n 5 Hans   2015-01-01 01:00:00     -60\n 6 Klara  2015-01-01 00:00:00      15\n 7 Klara  2015-01-01 00:15:00      15\n 8 Klara  2015-01-01 00:30:00      15\n 9 Klara  2015-01-01 00:45:00      15\n10 Klara  2015-01-01 01:00:00      NA\n\n\n\n\ngroup_by()\nYou might have noticed that timelag is calculated across different individuals (Hans and Klara), which does not make much sense. To avoid this, we need to specify that timelag should just be calculated between consecutive rows of the same individual. We can implement this by using group_by().\n\nwildschwein &lt;- group_by(wildschwein, TierID)\n\nAfter adding this grouping variable, calculating the timelag automatically accounts for the individual trajectories.\n\nwildschwein &lt;- mutate(wildschwein, timelag = as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC)))\n\nwildschwein\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n# Groups:   TierID [2]\n   TierID DatetimeUTC         timelag\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dttm&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Hans   2015-01-01 00:00:00      15\n 2 Hans   2015-01-01 00:15:00      15\n 3 Hans   2015-01-01 00:30:00      15\n 4 Hans   2015-01-01 00:45:00      15\n 5 Hans   2015-01-01 01:00:00      NA\n 6 Klara  2015-01-01 00:00:00      15\n 7 Klara  2015-01-01 00:15:00      15\n 8 Klara  2015-01-01 00:30:00      15\n 9 Klara  2015-01-01 00:45:00      15\n10 Klara  2015-01-01 01:00:00      NA\n\n\n\n\nsummarise()\nIf we want to summarise our data and get metrics per animal, we can use the dplyr function summarise(). In contrast to mutate(), which just adds a new column to the dataset, summarise() “collapses” the data to one row per individual (specified by group_by).\n\nsummarise(wildschwein, mean = mean(timelag, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  TierID  mean\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Hans      15\n2 Klara     15\n\n\nNote: You can do mutate() and summarise() on sf objects as well. However, summarise() tries to coerce all geometries into one object, which can take along time. To avoid this, use st_drop_geometry() before using summarise().\n\n\nPiping\nThe code above may be a bit hard to read, since it has so many nested functions which need to be read from the inside out. In order to make code readable in a more human-friendly way, we can use the piping command |&gt; from magrittr, which is included in dplyr and the tidyverse. The above code then looks like this:\n\nwildschwein |&gt;                                     # Take wildschwein...\n    group_by(TierID) |&gt;                            # ...group it by TierID\n    summarise(                                     # Summarise the data...\n        mean_timelag = mean(timelag, na.rm = TRUE) # ...by calculating the mean timelag\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  TierID mean_timelag\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Hans             15\n2 Klara            15",

You can calculate the time difference using the function difftime() in combination with lead().\n\nthe function difftime() has an option units. Set this to secs to get the time difference in seconds\nstore the output in a new column (e.g. timelag)\n\nNow inspect your data in more detail. Try to answer the following questions:\n\nHow many individuals were tracked?\nFor how long were the individual tracked? Are there gaps?\nWere all individuals tracked concurrently or sequentially?\nWhat is the temporal sampling interval between the locations?\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Deriving distance & speed\nIn this task we will derive some additional movement parameters from our trajectories. So far our trajectories only consist of a list of time-stamped spatial locations. First let’s calculate the Euclidean distance between subsequent locations using the function st_distance() with the option by_element = TRUE. Store these values in a new column with the name steplength. Next, you can calculate the animals’ speed based on steplength and the timelag (from the last task).\n\n\n\nTask 4: Speed at different scales\nIn preperation, you’ve read the paper by Laube and Purves (2011). In this paper, they analyse speed at different scales and compare these. Let’s reproduce what was done in the paper with cows to data of a moving wildboar named Caro. Download this dataset here: caro60.csv. This dataset includes 200 locations of a single wild boar with a constant sampling interval of 60 seconds. Import it just like you imported the other wild boar data and save it to a new variable named caro (note that the locations are stored in EPSG 2056).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Black points are used in calculation of movement parameters (e.g. speed) at a given termporal scale (from Laube and Purves (2011))\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1 shows how speed was calulated at three different scales. Let’s look at scale 1 first, where every location is included. For our data, this would mean a sampling window \\(w\\) of 120 seconds. The speed for a given sample (i.e. location) \\(t_{x}\\) is the time difference between \\(t_{x-1}\\) and \\(t_{x+1}\\) divided by the distance \\(t_{x-1}\\) to \\(t_{x+1}\\) via \\(t_{x}\\).\nTry to implement this in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\nMake this exercise match Laube and Purves (2011) better. The next two instructions are not correct\n\nNow manually reduce the granularity of our sampling interval by selecting every 3rd, 6th and 9th position and save the output to caro_3, caro_6,caro_9 accordingly. Tip: There are many ways to go about this, we recommend using seq() where from = 1, to = the length of the dataset and by = n (i.e. 3, 6 or 9). This creates an integer vector that can either used in dplyr::slice() or in row subsetting (type ?slice() or ?\"[.data.frame\" to get help on either of these methods).\n\n\n\nYou should now have 4 datasets with different number of rows:\n\nnrow(caro)\n## [1] 200\nnrow(caro_3)\n## [1] 67\nnrow(caro_6)\n## [1] 34\nnrow(caro_9)\n## [1] 23\n\nNow calculate timelag, steplength and speed for these data sets, just as you did in the last task. To finish the task, compare the speeds visually in a line plot and also visualize the trajectories in a map (see examples below). Interpret the line plot, what do the different lines for the different temporal granularities tell you?\n\n\n# A tibble: 67 × 6\n   TierID TierName CollarID DatetimeUTC                E        N\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:07:00 2570589. 1205095.\n 2 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:10:00 2570518. 1205115.\n 3 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:13:00 2570482. 1205124.\n 4 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:16:00 2570490. 1205100.\n 5 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:19:00 2570497. 1205092.\n 6 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:22:00 2570499. 1205091.\n 7 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:25:00 2570500. 1205087.\n 8 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:28:00 2570496. 1205094.\n 9 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:31:00 2570497. 1205091.\n10 010C   Caro        13973 2015-09-15 08:34:00 2570499. 1205091.\n# ℹ 57 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6: Add your movement data to your repository\nIn the semester project, you will analyse your own movement data, either collected with the Posmo App or with the GPS Tracker (see Preparation Project). Acquire this data and save it to a subfolder of your current R Project named data. To acquire it, proceed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO ⚠️\n\n\n\nChange the instructions to match FS24\n\n\n\nPosmo App Users\n\nGo to posmo.datamap.io and choose “Posmo Project”\nClick on the download button in the top right corner\nChoose an appropriate start and end date for which you want to download the data. Since you want all the data, you can choose 1. January until today\nClick on download\nMove the file from your downloads folder to the subfolder data in your current RStudio Project\n\nGPS Logger Users: Bring us your logger, we will extract your data and send it to you.\n\n\n\n\nTask 7: Explore your movement data\nNow, import your data in the same way you imported the the wild boar data in task 1. Next, start exploring your data, similarly as you did in task 2. At a minimum:\n\nImport your data as a data frame and convert it to an sf object, using the correct CRS information\nConvert your data to CH1903+ LV95\nMake a map of your data using ggplot2 or tmap.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaube, Patrick, and Ross S.

    "text": "We need to create a new RStudio Project with Git and Github this week. Last week you created an RStudio Project which was automatically connected to Github. You did this by first creating a Github Repo, and then initiating the RStudio Project via File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git (adding the URL of your Github Repo). This is definitely the easiest way to set up a connection, but what if you have an existing project that you want to connect to Github?\nIn this next section, we will go through setting up Git and Github without the use of RStudio. It will take slightly longer than the setup we used last week. Also, you will be confronted with some additional jargon.\nAs additional ressources to learning Git, we highly recommend:\n\nThe video tutorials by Corey Schafer or the very entertaining learning series Git and Github for Poets.\nHappy Git with Github for the useR is an excellent, easy to read, openly available book, written specifically for students working with R and RStudio in data science and related fields\n\n\nStep 1: Create a “normal” RStudio Project\nCreate a new RStudio Project File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project. This will create a “normal” RStudio Project without Git version control (and consequently without a Github connection). This is a typical situation for a project that you started without version control in mind. Choose the following settings:\n\nDirectory name: Choose a directory name that suits your structure\nCreate project as a subdirectory of: Choose a parent directory that suits your folder structure\nCreate a git repository: not checked (we will do this manually in the next step)\nUse renv with this project: not checked\n\n\n\nStep 2: Activate Git Version Control\nActivating Git Version Control for your project is one line of code. In your shell terminal, type the following command (which is what RStudio effectively does automatically when you activate the Create a git repository option while creating your project):\ngit init\nYou should get a message, saying Initialized empty Git repository in C:/path/to/your/directory/.git/. You will see this folder (named .git) in your project’s root directory (check your “Files” pane ). If you don’t see it there, click Refresh file listing (refresh symbol to the very right of the files pane). If you still don’t see it, make hidden files visible (Files pane &gt; More &gt; Show hidden files)\nTo see the “Git” Pane in RStudio, reload RStudio either by restarting it or clicking on the name of your RStudio project in the top right corner of RStudio and selecting your project from the project list).\n\n\nStep 3: Create a Github Repository\nNow create a Github Repository following the instructions from last week. This time however, don’t check Add a README file.\nCopy the https URL to your Github repo, which should look something like this: https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME/cma-week3.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nReport the URL of your new repo back to us via Moodle!\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Connect to Github\nTo connect your (local) RStudio Project to Github, we have to set up our Github repo to be our so called “remote” repository. We could have multiple remotes, which is why we need to name it, and the convention is to call it origin. To create a remote named origin, type the following command in your shell terminal:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME/cma-week3.git\nNow, before you can push anything to the remote repository, you need to commit something first. Last week, you used the Git Pane from RStudio to commit your files. Since we are already in the terminal, let’s use the terminal for this and in this way get to know git a little bit better.\nThere is one little that we glanced over till now. Before committing a file, you selected them first. This process is called adding to the staging area. To add your cma-week3.rproj to your git repo, type the following command:\n# Adjust the filename accordingly\ngit add cma-week3.rproj\nTo commit this file, type the following command\n# The text after -m is your commit message\ngit commit -m \"my initial commit\"\nThe first time we push to this remote repository, we need to specify the an upstream, so that future git push will be directed to the correct remote branch. We can to this with the --set-upstream (or -u)\nAssuming your branch is called main, type the following command. You can check the name of your branch with command git branch (the default branch name is either main or master).\ngit push --set-upstream origin main\nThis command prints a couple of messages, ending with the following statement: Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.. Now that the upstream (i.e.) tracking branch is correctly set up, you can also push via the Git pane in RStudio (you might need to refresh the Git pane first).",

    "text": "You’ve read Laube and Purves (2011) about segmenting trajectories. In the paper, the authors define “static” fixes as “those whose average Euclidean distance to other fixes inside a temporal window v is less than some threshold d”, as illustrated in the following figure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: The figure from Laube and Purves (2011) visualizes steps a) zu d), which will be explained below\n\n\n\n\nSpecify a temporal windows \\(v\\) for in which to measure Euclidean distances\nMeasure the distance from every point to every other point within this temporal window \\(v\\)\nRemove “static points”: These are points where the average distance is less than a given threshold. This segments the trajectory into subtrajectories\nNow remove short subtrajectories: These are trajectories with a short duration (whereas “short” is tbd)\n\nWe will demonstrate implementing this method on the wild boar “Sabi”, restricting ourselves to a couple of tracking days. Your task will be to understand this implementation and apply it to your own movement data.\nOpen the RStudio Project you have prepared for this week. Next, copy the wildboar data you downloaded last week (wildschwein_BE_2056.csv) to your project folder. If you cannot find this dataset on your computer, you can re-download it here\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(\"readr\")\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\n\nwildschwein &lt;- read_delim(\"datasets/wildschwein_BE_2056.csv\", \",\")\n\n# Careful!

The circle highlingts possible ‘static points’\n\n\n\n\n\nStep a): Specify a temporal window \\(v\\)\nIn the above dataset, the sampling interval is 15 minutes. If we take a temporal window of 60 minutes, that would mean including 4 fixes. We need to calculate the following Euclidean distances (pos representing single location):\n\npos[n-2] to pos[n]\npos[n-1] to pos[n]\npos[n] to pos[n+1]\npos[n] to pos[n+2]\n\n\n\nStep b): Measure the distance from every point to every other point within this temporal window \\(v\\)\nJust like last week, we use the formula for calculating the Euclidean distance in in combination with lead() and lag(). For example, to create the necessary offset of n-2, we use lag(x, 2). For each offset, we create one individual column.\n\nsabi &lt;- sabi |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        nMinus2 = sqrt((lag(E, 2) - E)^2 + (lag(N, 2) - N)^2), # distance to pos -30 minutes\n        nMinus1 = sqrt((lag(E, 1) - E)^2 + (lag(N, 1) - N)^2), # distance to pos -15 minutes\n        nPlus1  = sqrt((E - lead(E, 1))^2 + (N - lead(N, 1))^2), # distance to pos +15 mintues\n        nPlus2  = sqrt((E - lead(E, 2))^2 + (N - lead(N, 2))^2) # distance to pos +30 minutes\n    )\n\nNow we want to calculate the mean distance of nMinus2, nMinus1, nPlus1, nPlus2 for each row. Since we want the mean value per Row, we have to explicitly specify this before mutate() with the function rowwise(). To remove this rowwise-grouping, we end the operation with ungroup().\nNote that for the first two positions, we cannot calculate a stepMean since there is no Position n-2 for these positions. This is also true for the last to positions (lacking a position n+2).\n\nsabi &lt;- sabi |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        stepMean = mean(c(nMinus2, nMinus1, nPlus1, nPlus2))\n    ) |&gt;\n    ungroup()\n\nsabi\n\n# A tibble: 192 × 11\n   TierID TierName CollarID DatetimeUTC                E       N nMinus2 nMinus1\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:00:13 2569972.  1.21e6   NA      NA   \n 2 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:16:06 2569975.  1.21e6   NA     271.  \n 3 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:30:19 2570266.  1.21e6  573.    365.  \n 4 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 22:45:13 2570208.  1.21e6  361.     80.5 \n 5 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:00:10 2570247.  1.21e6  127.    186.  \n 6 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:15:17 2570512.  1.21e6  703.    524.  \n 7 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:30:38 2570684.  1.21e6  766.    247.  \n 8 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-06-30 23:45:16 2570526.  1.21e6  229.    167.  \n 9 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-07-01 00:00:10 2570532.  1.21e6  163.      9.33\n10 002A   Sabi        12275 2015-07-01 00:15:14 2570530.  1.21e6    8.98   15.4 \n# ℹ 182 more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: nPlus1 &lt;dbl&gt;, nPlus2 &lt;dbl&gt;, stepMean &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\nStep c): Remove “static points”\nWe can now determine if an animal is moving or not by specifying a threshold distance on stepMean.

Export your data from your provider and import is as a data.frame in R.\n\nlibrary(\"readr\")\nlibrary(\"sf\")\n\nposmo &lt;- read_delim(\"datasets/posmo_2022-05-01T00 00 00+02 00-2023-04-18T23 59 59+02 00.csv\")\n\n# Keep only the necessary columns\nposmo &lt;- select(posmo, datetime, lon_x, lat_y)\n\nAs before, we will calculate the euclidean distance “by hand”. This means we need the coordinates of our locations stored in a Projected CRS. Our data is stored in a geodetic coordinate reference system (WGS84, i.e. EPSG 4326). We can transform the data to EPSG 2056 with the function st_transform, as we explained in the first week.\n\nposmo &lt;- st_as_sf(posmo, coords = c(\"lon_x\",\"lat_y\"), crs = 4326) |&gt;\n  st_transform(2056)\n\nhead(posmo)\n\nTo be able to compute euclidean distances by hand, we need the coordinates stored in separate columns. The function st_coordinates extracts the coordinates from our sf object. We can bind these coordinates back to our sf object using cbind\n\nposmo_coordinates &lt;- st_coordinates(posmo)\n\nposmo &lt;- cbind(posmo, posmo_coordinates)\n\nExplore your data and choose a single day for the next steps.\n\nposmo_filter &lt;- posmo |&gt;\n    filter(as.Date(datetime) == \"2023-03-23\")\n\nOnce you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. Before committing, make sure your location data is ignored. Then, test your connection to Github by pushing your changes to your remote repository.\n\n\nTask 1: Segmentation\nNow, you can implement steps a) b) and c), which you had used with sabi, on on your own movement data. Once you have completed the task, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message and test your connection to Github by pushing your changes to your remote repository.\n\n\nTask 2: Specify and apply threshold d\nAfter calculating the Euclidean distances to positions within the temporal window v in task 1, you can explore these values (we stored them in the column stepMean) using summary statistics (histograms, boxplot, summary()): This way we can define a reasonable threshold value to differentiate between stops and moves. There is no “correct” way of doing this, specifying a threshold always depends on data as well as the question that needs to be answered. In this exercise, use the mean of all stepMean values.\nStore the new information (boolean to differentiate between stops (TRUE) and moves (FALSE)) in a new column named static.\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\n\nTask 3: Visualize segmented trajectories\nNow visualize the segmented trajectory spatially. Just like last week, you can use ggplot with geom_path(), geom_point() and coord_equal(). Assign colour = static within aes() to distinguish between segments with “movement” and without.\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\n\nTask 4: Segment-based analysis\nIn applying Laube and Purves (2011), we’ve come as far as step b) in Figure 12.1. In order to complete the last steps (c and d), we need a unique ID for each segment that we can use as a grouping variable. The following function does just that (it assigns unique IDs based on the column static which you created in Task 2). You will learn about functions next week. For now, just copy the following code chunk into your script and run it.\n\nrle_id &lt;- function(vec) {\n    x &lt;- rle(vec)$lengths\n    as.factor(rep(seq_along(x), times = x))\n}\n\nYou can use the newly created function rle_id to assign unique IDs to subtrajectories (as shown below). Visualize the moving segments by colourizing them by segment_ID. Then use segment_ID as a grouping variable to determine the segments duration and remove short segments (e.g. segments with a duration &lt; 5 Minutes)\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\nposmo_filter &lt;- posmo_filter |&gt;\n    mutate(segment_id = rle_id(static))\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'posmo_filter' not found\n\nhead(posmo_filter)\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'posmo_filter' not found\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Similarity measures\nWe will now calculate similarties between trajectories using a new dataset pedestrian.csv. Download an import this dataset as a data.frame or tibble. It it a set of six different but similar trajectories from pedestrians walking on a path.\nFor this task, explore the trajectories first and get an idea on how the pedestrians moved.\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n\n\nTask 6: Calculate similarity\nInstall the package SimilarityMeasures (install.packages(\"SimilarityMeasures\")). Familiarize yourself with this package by skimming through the function descriptions help(package = \"SimilarityMeasures\"). Now compare trajectory 1 to trajectories 2-6 using different similarity measures from the package. Your options are. DTW, EditDist, Frechet and LCSS.\nBefore visualizing your results think about the following: Which two trajectories to you percieve to be most similar, which are most dissimilar? Now visualize the results from the computed similarity measures. Which measure reflects your own intuition the closest?\nNote:\n\nAll functions in the package need matrices as input, with one trajectory per matrix.\nLCSStakes very long to compute. The accuracy of the algorithm (pointSpacing = ,pointDistance = and errorMarg =) can be varied to provide faster calculations. Please see Vlachos, Gunopoulos, and Kollios (2002) for more information.\n\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message.

    "text": "Open your RStudio Project which you prepared from this week. Create a new RScript and import the libraries we need for this week.

This is a vector dataset stored in the filetype Geopackage, which is similar to a Shapefile, with some advantages (see the website shapefile must die).\nAlso download the dataset vegetationshoehe_LFI.tif. This is a “raster” dataset stored in a Geotiff, similar to the map we imported in week 1. Also store this file in your project folder and commit these to your repo.\n\nTasks 1: Import and visualize spatial data\nSince Feldaufnahmen_Fanel.gpkg is a vector dataset, you can import it using read_sf(). Explore this dataset in R to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat information does the dataset contain?\nWhat is the geometry type of the dataset (possible types are: Point, Lines and Polygons)?\nWhat are the data types of the other columns?\nWhat is the coordinate system of the dataset?\n\n\n\nTask 2: Annotate Trajectories from vector data\nWe would like to know what crop was visited by which wild boar, and at what time. Since the crop data is most relevant in summer, filter your wildboar data to the months may to june first and save the output to a new variable. Overlay the filtered dataset with your fanel data to verify the spatial overlap.\nTo sematically annotate each wildboar location with crop information, you can use a spatial join with the function st_join(). Do this and explore your annotated dataset.\n\n\nTask 3: Explore annotated trajectories\nThink of ways you could visually explore the spatio-temporal patterns of wild boar in relation to the crops. In our example below we visualize the percentage of samples in a given crop per hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Import and visualize vegetationindex (raster data)\nYou have already downloaded the dataset vegetationshoehe_LFI.tif. Import this dataset\nIn terms of raster data, we have prepared the Vegetation Height Model provided by the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). This dataset contains high resolution information (1x1 Meter) on the vegetation height, which is determined from the difference between the digital surface models DSM and the digital terrain model by swisstopo (swissAlti3D). Buildings are eliminated using a combination of the ground areas of the swisstopo topographic landscape model (TLM) and spectral information from the stereo aerial photos.\nImport the dataset just like you imported the raster map in week 1 (using terra::rast()). Visualize the raster data using tmap (ggplot is very slow with raster data).\n\n\nTask 5: Annotate Trajectories from raster data\nSemantically annotate your wildboar locations with the vegetation index (similar as you did with the crop data in Task 2). Since you are annotating a vector dataset with information from a raster dataset, you cannot use st_join but need the function extract from the terra package. Read the help on the extract function to see what the function expects. The output should look something like this:\nYou can now explore the spatiotemporal patterns of this new data.\n\n\nSubmission\nTo submit your exercise, provide us with the URL of your Github repo as described in the preperation.",
