Save your (R/RMarkdown/Quarto) file\n2. Switch to the \"Git\"-Tab in the pane in the top right corner\n3. Click \"commit\" to open the \"Commit Window\"\n4. Click in the checkbox next to the file(s) you want to commit\n5. Add a commit message to explain what you are committing (e.g. \"`initial commit`\")\n6. Click on \"commit\" to commit your changes\n:::\n\n\n## Mapmatching GPS points to the road network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\n\n# Get a sample road dataset\nHighWays <- read_sf(system.file(\"sqlite/test3.sqlite\",package=\"sf\"), \"HighWays\")[6, ] \n\n# since we want to find the closest location on the road over ALL roads\n# we need to create a union of the roads first.\nHighWays <- st_union(HighWays)\n\n# Let's simulate 1000 GPS locations within 3km of the highway\ngps_locations <- HighWays |> st_buffer(3000) |> st_sample(100)\n\n# Now we can get the nearset point for each GPS location\nnearest <- st_nearest_points(gps_locations, HighWays)\n\n# The output is a line for each point (see plot below)\n# Now we need convert the output from LINE to POINT. \n# This doubles the number of features\nnear_p <- st_cast(nearest, \"POINT\")\n\n# now we subset the points.

Go to [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com/)\n2. Deselect all \"Products\" and select only the following product: *Location History (Timeline)*\n4. Click *Next* and *Create Export* to get an Export of your data (see @fig-google-takeout)\n5. Download and extract the data in your R-Project folder\n6. Follow the script below (adjust the path!)\n\n\n```{.r}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nrecords_json <- jsonlite::read_json(\"takeout-20240501T094208Z-001/Takeout/Location History (Timeline)/Records.json\",simplifyVector = TRUE)\n\nrecords <- records_json[[1]]\n\n# inspired by the following SO-answer\n# https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/319067/40929\nrecords_sf <- records |> \n  mutate(\n    lat = latitudeE7/1e7,\n    lon = longitudeE7/1e7\n  ) |> \n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"lon\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\n```\n\n\n\n![](../02_Images/google-takeout.png){#fig-google-takeout}",
