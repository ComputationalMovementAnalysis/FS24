## Preparation {#w6-preperation}

Create a new RStudio Project and a new Github Repo for this week's exercises similar to [Exercise 4](#w4-preparation).

If you want to publish your Report as a website (to share with others), activate Github Pages by going to your repo on Github, clicking on *Settings > Pages*, and under *Source* switch from *None* to your Main branch. **You can do this only after pushing your first commit**.
